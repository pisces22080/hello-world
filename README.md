training to use github via hello-world

My name is Chris. I live in Oklahoma City. I've always been inbterested in learning programming. I've never been taught anything officially but have always tried. I came across github when I was rooting my phone, by chance. I noticed that it teaches you how to use the site, which in turn teaches you how to code. I can't wait to see what I learn and develop along the way.
